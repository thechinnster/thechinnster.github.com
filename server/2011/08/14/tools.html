	<h2><a href=''>Tools</a></h2>
	
  <p>Tools are important. I once spent 6 months renovating a house and although I didn&#8217;t really know what was doing I was lucky enough to be working with somebody who did. This is the advice she gave me: use the right tool for the job and make sure your body is in the right position when you&#8217;re using it. Following this advice got me through many home improvement tasks efficiently and without injury. Surely it&#8217;s a different story when we&#8217;re talking about knowledge work though, right? Let&#8217;s see.</p>

<h4 id='use_the_right_tool_for_the_job'>Use the right tool for the job</h4>

<p>Even for those of use sitting in an office in front of a computer screen all day this is important.</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows or Mac or Linux?</li>

<li>Vim or Emacs or Textmate or <span>insert other editor here</span>?</li>

<li>Sitting or standing?</li>

<li>Subversion or Git?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are meaninful questions and the answers make a difference. Everybody in my team at work uses a Mac. I believe this gives my work environment a different character from the offices I&#8217;ve worked in where folks were on difference platforms or were all on Windows machines. I think it&#8217;s that my team feels less &#8220;corporate&#8221; even though we work within a corporate environment. Are Macs better? Maybe. What&#8217;s for certain is that they evoke a different response in their users and they are more conducive to certain kinds of work. As Doug Rushkoff argues in his book, <a href='http://www.orbooks.com/our-books/program/'>Program or Be Programmed</a> technologies have biases that we generally take for granted. Using the right technology means making these biases work for you.</p>

<h4 id='put_your_body_in_the_right_position'>Put your body in the right position</h4>

<p>This comes down to using the tool correctly. If you <em>love</em> vim but find you&#8217;re spending half your day creating macros then maybe you need an editor that gives you less opportunity to fiddle. If you&#8217;ve got 100 emails in your inbox each of which you read every time a new message comes in then maybe you should be taking a different attitude toward your mail application.</p>

<p>All this being said, what are the tools that I use?</p>

<ul>
<li>A iMac at home and MacBook Pro in the office.</li>

<li>Transmit, iTerm2 for web development.</li>

<li>Safari and Chrome for web browsing.</li>

<li>Apple Mail.app for work emails, Sparrow for personal messages through gmail. I&#8217;ve been going back and forth from Mailplane and Sparrow and am still not sure what fits me best.</li>

<li>TextExpander, Keyboard Maestro and Launchbar. These three help me automate or speed a bunch of tasks I perform every day.</li>

<li>Omnifocus for task management</li>

<li>iPhone and iPad. I use calendar and address book almost exclusively on iOS rather than the mac.</li>

<li>Multiple tools for writing and coding. Textmate is the heavy hitter in this department and I&#8217;ll second those who say that even with its flaws and lack of visible development it still does a terrific job. I also use Nvalt for tracking text files on the Mac and a bunch of apps on iOS: Simplenote, Notesy and Writing Kit top the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to post more about some of these tools and how to make the best of them.</p>
