	<h2><a href=''>iPad Impressions from a New User</a></h2>
	
  <p>I&#8217;ve had an iPad 2 for almost a week now and while I&#8217;m late to the game I&#8217;m ready to share my impressions. By the way when I say late I mean really late, as in I skipped the first iPad and this is the first one I have owned. My feeling a year ago was that the iPad was a terrific product that would become fully mature with a second release. Given everything I&#8217;ve <a href='http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/03/ipad-2-the-ars-review.ars'>read</a> <a href='http://daringfireball.net/2011/03/the_ipad_2'>on the</a> <a href='http://www.suntimes.com/4396870-420/review-ipad-2-is-not-revolutionary-but-it-is-great.html'>subject</a> it seems that I was correct. I can&#8217;t talk about the increased speed of the iPad 2 or any other improvements over the original but I will give my perspective on the device and how I think I&#8217;ll be using it.</p>

<h4 id='just_a_big_iphone'>Just a Big iPhone?</h4>

<p>When I first started using the iPad I couldn&#8217;t help but compare it to the iPhone 4 I&#8217;ve had for almost a year. I love how the home screen adjusts with the orientation of the device (unlike the iPhone), I love how the wifi signal stays strong throughout my home (unlike the iPhone) and I like typing on the iPad (unlike the iPhone). I&#8217;m still not sure how much I like reading on the iPad though - even with its much smaller screen the iPhone&#8217;s retina display makes reading more pleasant to my eyes than the iPad&#8217;s pixelated text. No doubt this issue will become moot within another release cycle or two.</p>

<p>The iPad impresses me most of all as a <em>computer</em>. My two year old son calls the iPhone simply &#8220;phone&#8221;. When he first saw the iPad he said &#8220;little &#8216;puter&#8221; (it was adorable, truly). I&#8217;m finding myself using the iPad to do all the things I would usually rather do on my laptop: process email, write notes, visit web sites, etc. In some ways these tasks are even more enjoyable on the iPad especially since I can do them more easily on the sofa without waiting for a computer to start up or shut down when I&#8217;m finished. As I mentioned earlier I&#8217;m even liking typing on the iPad, especially with the benefit of auto correction, which although a mixed bag I&#8217;m still finding more of a help than a hindrance.</p>

<h4 id='so_close_to_perfection'>So Close to Perfection</h4>

<p>After all this gushing I&#8217;ll bring up one quibble. Although it&#8217;s great that the home screens can display properly in landscape mode it&#8217;s a pain that it changes the layout of the icons. For me, recognition of each icon has a lot to do with its relative position on the screen and it&#8217;s confusing for that position to change when I rotate the device.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have a lot more to say about the iPad as I continue to use it and learn how it&#8217;s going to fit into my life and workflows. Meanwhile I continue to be inspired by what I feel is the beginning of a real revolution in computing interfaces.</p>
