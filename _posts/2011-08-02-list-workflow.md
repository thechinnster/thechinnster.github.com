title: Grocery List Workflow
---

[Listary][2] is a terrific little iPhone app that has enabled a terrific workflow for putting together my grocery list.  Basically it allows you to easily create checklists which can be synced to the cloud via [Simplenote][3].  The best part for me is that the app can take any text file and turn it into a checklist with a checkbox for each line.  So, here's my workflow:

1.  Create a grocery list file which then gets synced up between Simplenote, Listary and [nvAlt][1] on my Mac.  
2.  Get an email from my wife including some more items to put on the list.  Add those items to the list in nvAlt.
3.  Go to the grocery store, open up Listary on my iPhone and see all the items I need to buy as a checklist that I can check off as I go.

That's it.
