I was just faced with *that email*. You know, the one that sits in the inbox from somebody you don't have time to deal with asking for something you don't have time to do. I don't want to blow it off completely because there's a chance that the relationship or the offer being made may be valuable but I don't want to do anything about it right now either. That message had been in my inbox for days floating among the flotsam and jetsam of other message cruft until I processed my messages today and it was the last one staring me in the face, mocking me. To make things worse this was a follow up email asking for a reply after I had already ignored an earlier one.

I had a few options:

1. Ignore it, and have it keep taunting me.
2. Delete it, and probably receive another follow up.
3. Reply to it.

With those options in front of me I could see that number three was the only acceptable course of action. So I sent a short message in reply saying that I wasn't going to take the time to act on the matter right now but I'd get to it and send a reply in a couple of weeks. Then I created an action in [Omnifocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/ "OmniFocus for Mac - The Omni Group") to take the required action with a start date of a week from now.

That felt good.  It felt like I had just given myself the gift of a week or two and had sent a clear but polite message that I had more important things to do and would reply in my own time rather than respond to any further badgering. The next step is to convert my message into a template for automating replies to similar solicitations, which I receive fairly often. 

For me this is what [Getting Things Done](http://www.davidco.com/) is all about: finding ways to blow away the annoying bits of friction creating grit so I can get back to the real stuff of my life.
