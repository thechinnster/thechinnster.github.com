The above is what I saw when [searching for "HTML Entities" on Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=html+entities). I was expecting a page of links, one of which might lead to a page I've used as a reference in the past to find HTML entities. Instead DDG showed me a table that gave me exactly what I was looking for (`&laquo;` actually).

Already glad I've set up [Duck Duck Go as my default search engine](https://duck.co/help/desktop/chrome).
