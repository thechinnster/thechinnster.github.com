After viewing [this video][1] about how Facebook is not only invasive and unethical but also dishonest I've deleted my Facebook account. I've deactivated my account in the past and reactivated when I found some service that required an account for authorization. Now I'm done. My account with all its data will be deleted and if there's any service that requires a Facebook account for me to use it then they won't have me as a user (this actually just came up with beta of [Humin][2], a new service that looked pretty neat but has lost me as a member because they require a Facebook account for registration).

I haven't been an active user of Facebook in years and their blatant disregard for the privacy of their users has convinced me to go from a passive member to a ex-member. You can join me by [following this link][3].
