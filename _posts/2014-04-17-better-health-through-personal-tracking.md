I can pinpoint the moment when I started getting out of shape. It was January 3rd, 2009. It was also one of the most joyous days of my life, the day of my son's birth. Since then his sister was born and I've lost plenty of sleep as well as any practice I had previously maintained for exercise and keeping healthy. Over the years I've noticed the addition of some pounds to my weight, loss of energy and some chronic aches and pains, not to mention the increase in the number and duration of diseases I pick up every year, mostly thanks to the Petri dish nature of preschool.  Rather than beating myself up over these lapses I'm slowly improving the situation thanks to a bit of attention and some hardware and software. 

The hardware is a [fitbit zip](), which I received for free from my employer in return for volunteering to have my some health diagnostics done (a nice example of a helpful [nudge](!amazon "nudge book" )). The zip is little more than a tiny pedometer that I keep in a pocket that tracks my steps, distance travelled and duration of physical activity. The zip syncs with my iPhone which shows me that data for each day as well as graphs to show the data over days, weeks and months.
