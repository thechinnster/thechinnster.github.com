I came across a post on [Jackson Egan's blog][001] about a using git with mobile devices and realized this is what I had been looking for. This blog runs on [Github Pages][002] which means that changes get deployed through pushing git commits to Github. Since I do some writing on my iPad it would be great to post to the blog from there as well. Jackson's suggestion of a remote staging server was the tip I needed to put the new workflow into practice. This post is a test of this mobile posting setup.
