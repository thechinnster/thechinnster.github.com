Recently I went on a trip across the country for five days and had to pack for myself and my son, trying to take only what we could bring on the plane. I managed to pack everything into a small carry on bag, a backpack for my laptop and my son's books and his tiny backpack for food for the plane. Then I had to think about what I should bring to read. 

I had just started reading [Neal Stephenson's *Quicksilver*][1] and didn't want to lose the thread of the story by parting with it for several days. Alas the book clocks in at over a thousand pages. Try as I might I could not fit that gargantuan tome into my carry on bags or our suitcase. Honestly, I would have been hard pressed to fit a magazine into our baggage such was the degree to which I had compressed all our stuff into a small carry on suitcase.

I was about to give up on Stephenson's novel when I decided to take a look at Amazon for the [kindle version][2]. Amazingly that huge book costs only $6. Since I came by the hardcover version for free at a local library event I had no problem forking over a little cash for the convenience of being able to take the book with me on our trip. I suppose I could have read the whole thing on my phone and not had to pack anything extra at all but I brought along my Kindle (3rd generation with keyboard) and enjoyed reading it on the plane as well as over the long weekend.

**Update:** Since I wrote the preceding paragraphs I've become troubled by Amazon's heavy handed tactics in negotiating with Hachette, the publisher from whom they are attempting to win — one might say extort — concessions by slowing down or stopping delivery of books that Hachette publishes. I've decided to stop purchasing books from Amazon in print or digital format until the situation is remedied. Amazon's actions in this matter leave a bad  taste in my mouth and I'm hoping it abandons these strong arm tactics in favor  of providing the kind of customer focused service that has made it great.
