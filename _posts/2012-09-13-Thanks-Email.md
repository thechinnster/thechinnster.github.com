Gabe over at Macdrifter [stands up for the "thanks" email](http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/09/the-thanks-email.html "The Thanks Email"), and Ben Brooks [strongly disagrees](http://brooksreview.net/2012/09/thanks-email/ "&#8216;The Thanks Email&#8217; â€” The Brooks Review"). I'm with Brooks on this one in finding the extra email annoying and not wanting to clog up others' inboxes with the same. Basically I trust that my emails are being received and that if somebody is expecting something from me and doesn't get it they will let me know. Likewise, if I need confirmation of receipt of a message I can ask for it. 

The short of it is this: I've never wished I had received a thank you message when I didn't.
