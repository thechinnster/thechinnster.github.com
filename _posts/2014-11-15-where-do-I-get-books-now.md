title: Where Do I Get Books Now?

I had been avoiding purchasing any books – electronic or print – from Amazon.com while their vendetta against Hachette was raging. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth and seemed unfair to the publisher, its authors and their readers, as well as a display of near monopolistic hubris by Amazon. I do a lot of reading on a Kindle so I had to resort to other ways of getting books on there, mostly by borrowing ebooks from the library. 

Now it seems [the parties have settled](http://recode.net/2014/11/13/amazon-and-hachette-end-e-book-feud-with-new-contract/), with Hachette seeming to have secured the better part of the deal.

Am I going to start loading up on reading material from Amazon? Probably not. Even at its best, Amazon may have too much power when it comes to selling books.  I'll be trying to spread my money around a little when I buy books from now on.
