There are three major steps to working on any task or project

1. Figure out what to do next.
2. Get started.
3. Follow through until the work is done.

I'm going to talk about step 2: Getting Started.

A [certain episode](http://5by5.tv/b2w/20) of Back to Work focused on this problem and the show keeps on coming back to it. Not only is it almost impossible to see oneself engaged in an unstarted activity, it's even difficult to see oneself creating something when one is already doing it. This is the phenomenon of the artist who claims that he is merely a conduit for creativity, not the source. Hence the gift from God, the inspiration from the muse, the channeling of unseen forces to usher forth the creative act. All this is a way for people to avoid taking credit for their own creativity. And why?  Why would we want to distance ourselves from the product of our own labor in this way?  I think there are a few reasons. 

### The Reason from selfishness

It makes the artist into magician. If creative acts are a gift of the divine then only a priestly class will be blessed with the ability to commune with the divine in this way. This gives to the artist a higher status (serving the creative individual) and also limits the number of people who will attempt such creative expression (serving those who might wish to limit the number of artists). 

### The reason from neurology

Creation at a high level is an extraordinary. Almost by definition it requires a state of mind that is different from what is necessary for everyday functioning. It therefore is interpreted by the mind as not being connected to the self. The experience of creation is so strange that the product of that experience is immediately disowned. 

### The reason from ignorance 

We don't know much about how artistic creation happens.  It is mysterious and like so many mysteries we sidestep the explanation for it by attributing it to supernatural forces.  Enter the god of the gaps.
