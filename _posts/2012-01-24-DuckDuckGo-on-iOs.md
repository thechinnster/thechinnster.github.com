I'm with Ben Brooks in [ditching Google for DuckDuckGo](http://brooksreview.net/2012/01/duckduckwin/). He talks about replacing the default search for Safari and Chrome, which I've already done. I would add the suggestion that you use [Cyberspace](http://cyberspaceapp.com/), a great web browser for iPad and iPhone that uses DuckDuckGo as its default search engine.
