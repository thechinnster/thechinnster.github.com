A lot of people are liking the new [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) (formerly Read It Later) which now sports a new look and features focusing on saving all kinds of web content from anywhere. Pocket now is more clearly differentiated from [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) which continues to be all about saving text to read later even though you can post any kind of web page to Instapaper as well. I'm liking Pocket but still love Instapaper and can see how each service may be useful to me depending on what context I'm working in and how I feel like viewing the content I've saved.

So why choose? Why not save once and have my chosen web content saved to both Instapaper and Pocket? I tried for a while to find a way to do this before discovering a solution using [ifttt](http://ifttt.com/) (or If This Then That) a terrific service that integrates with numerous online services to create all kinds of interesting workflows. There's a built in trigger for ifttt that lets you work with Pocket items that you've marked as read, but I didn't want to interact with Pocket to get its items to Instapaper or vice versa. The key was discovering that my Instapaper list generates an RSS feed. With that I could easily set up a task that took the URL of any page added to that feed and posted it to Pocket. I could have done it the other way (Pocket RSS to Instapaper) but since Instapaper is a bit better supported by various apps I thought it best that items get sent there first.

I set up a [recipe for ifttt](http://ifttt.com/recipes/33702) that you can use to acheive the same result. The RSS feed being used is the one for my Instapaper unread folder so you'll want to edit the task by pasting in your own feed's URL instead. Even if you don't find this useful I highly recommend seeing what else you can do with ifttt.
