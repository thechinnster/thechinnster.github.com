As a Netflix customer I'm not thrilled about the Netflix/Qwikster shakeup. Sadly today's business environment doesn't necessarily reward good customer service. It rewards growth.  DVD rentals are [not where the growth is][1] so Netflix has siloed that part of the business to focus on the fast growing market in streaming content.  I just hope they deliver on their promise of vastly expanding their streaming library, otherwise this deal is going to be even harder for customers to swallow.
