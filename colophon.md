This site is a work in progress, maintained partly to share my thoughts with the few people that might care to read them, but mostly to give me an opportunity to experiment with the site itself using the following tools:

*	[**Jekyll**](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "mojombo/jekyll - GitHub"): "a simple, blog aware, static site generator."  Using Jekyll as a blog engine satisfies my preference for working with text files and markdown in the text editor of my choosing.  Which brings me to...
*	[**Textmate**](http://macromates.com/ "TextMate — The Missing Editor for Mac OS X"): The best text editor I've found despite its few limitations and [complete lack of recent updates](http://wiki.macromates.com/FAQ/TextMate2 "FAQ / TextMate2 browse — TextMate Wiki").
*	[**iTerm 2**](http://iterm2.com/ "iTerm2 - Mac OS Terminal Replacement"): A terrific replacement for the OS X Terminal application.

Special thanks to those that have solved some problems so I don't have to:

*	[**Kilian Valkhof's Sencss**](http://sencss.kilianvalkhof.com/ "SenCSs - the sensible standards CSS baseline"): A CSS baseline file for implementing sensible typographic defaults.
*	[**Bruce Williams**](http://codefluency.com/): whose blog source I mined to create this site.  Since I did that he seems to have moved his site off Jekyll and I can't find his code on github any more.
